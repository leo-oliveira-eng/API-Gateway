## Dependencies

Api Gateway uses the message and connection packages generated by API Make-Magic-Challenge that can be followed in the link of the repository already mentioned. It also uses the Message.Response.Maybe Package, which encapsulates objects exchanged between methods and indicates the status of the same, preventing null objects from being passed through the application.
